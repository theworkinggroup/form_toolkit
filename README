FormToolkit
===========

FormToolkit is a Rails plugin to make creating and managing forms easier.

There are three basic form types:

 * Basic - Standard <form> element with submission by HTTP.
 * AjaxSubmit - Standard <form> with a remote XHR call on submit.
 * LiveEdit - Each field independently managed and submitted on change.
